## Introduction

This year has been interesting for me since I have been willingly making myself do some public speaking.
With varying degrees of success. So far I have given 4 talks at meetups this year (Event Loop, Intro to Vue, ENV in PHP and Learning PHP in 2019).
While giving a few talks does not make me an expert in anything it has taught me some lessons to help me prepare better talks in the future. I hope
that by sharing this few pointers you can be more prepared for when you venture out to give a talk.

### 1. Prepare more content than you need

The worst thing that keeps happening to me is preparing a 30-minute talk practicing over and over to go on "stage" and forget to say half of the things
you were planning on saying. This is even more important when giving a more technical talk since glossing over certain things will leave gaps for your audience
about the concept at hand. In a perfect world, you will remember all your lines but if you are like me who is terrified of being in front of a crowd. Then it is better
to have a few examples that touch the same concept just in case you only remember one.

### 2. Have a why and a goal

Have a reason for giving the talk. For example, my talk about the event loop was due to trying to grasp a few concepts in node that kept giving me headaches and bugs, well mainly bugs. One thing while I had a good reason to be excited about the event loop, I missed one key point. I did not consider what I wanted to leave my audience. For my Vue talk, I made a clear goal of making my audience wanting to go out there and learn Vue. So have a why and a goal.

### 3. Don't sweat it

Giving a talk should be fun. If you mess up, it is okay. If your community is worth your time they will support you and give you feedback to help you improve.
